One of the most fundamental sentence structures in Japanese is of the form:

AがB。

Where A is a noun and B is an adjective.  This is probably the simplest idea as we're just making a simple statement describing a noun.

Let's look at some examples: -

<details>
	<summary>{猫|ねこ}がかわいい。</summary>
	Cat is cute.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>{空|そら}が{青|あお}い。</summary>
	Sky is blue.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>{街|まち}がしずかだ。</summary>
</details>

(note: i know we said to use actual examples but idk how to search through my stuff for things this basic so just went with some very simple things in addition to the cat one - k)

Since it ends with an adjective, this is called an "adjective phrase".
