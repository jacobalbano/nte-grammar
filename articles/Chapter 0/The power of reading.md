We learn languages through massive exposure to comprehensible, intresting material. There's a guy called Stephen Krashen who carried out a lot of research on this and you might see his name pop up from time to time. There's a lecture of his linked below that goes through the his main idea of "Comprehensible Input".

It may seem like you need to understand everything you read 100% in order to make progress, but this isn't the case - in fact, reading a large amount of things, even if you don't fully (or even barely) understand the things you're reading, is actually the best way to go as this increases your chances of coming across something you _do_ understand (or very nearly completely understand) and it's these sentences that get you the most progress.

Below is a brief overview of the many media available for immersion.

Manga/Anime: highly recommended for all levels; perhaps the best source of input for beginners 

Novels: great for early intermediate and beyond

Visual novels: high average difficulty, but there are lots of good tools which can help

Audiobooks/podcasts: only recommended for advanced learners due to low supporting context

Music: not recommended for study purposes at all
