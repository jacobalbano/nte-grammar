Kanji is the final script used for writing the Japanese language.  It's a set of thousands of pictograms imported from Chinese a very long time ago.

In modern Japanese there are generally two types of word that use kanji: imported words and native Japanese words.

The imported words are things taken straight from Chinese but read/pronounced using a Japanese approximation of the Chinese sounds.

The native Japanese words are words that already existed in Japanese and were simply given a kanji to match the meaning.

You may have heard that kanji is the final boss of Japanese or maybe it's just something you're scared of doing since you've heard there's a lot of them. Now it is true that there's a lot of them and it does seem daunting at first, but thankfully there are lots of resources out there to help you on your journey.  This guide itself isn't designed to be a kanji learning course, but we've all been through the kanji journey somewhat and we can wholeheartedly recommend the following resources.

WaniKani (WK):
https://www.wanikani.com/
WaniKani uses an SRS (Spaced Repetition System) to teach you radicals (the building blocks of kanji), kanji, and words associated with the kanji you're learning. It's separated into levels and you level up by getting answers right enough times in a row.  Several of the authors of this guide used this, but it does cost $9/mo after the first few levels and you can't speed the process up at all which some people don't like.

Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course (KKLC):
This is a textbook designed to teach you kanji in a way similar to WK - it starts off with simple kanji and then builds more kanji using the things you already know (plus associated vocab like WK).  Since this is a textbook it's a one off cost so no recurring subscriptions. If you prefer setting your own pace and are okay with setting up your own lessons and stuff, this is definitely a great option that you might like more than WK.

In addition to those resources for learning kanji, one of our authors, Morg, has a great site going over the basics in more detail with a lot of links for even more detail. If you want to get a bit deeper into kanji, then definitely give this a read:

(note: not sure if this is the link meant in the todo so have just put the generic kanji link for now - k)

Throughout this guide we will use kanji vocabulary (with furigana - small kana above the kanji to show you how to read it) in the example sentences.  We'll do this sparingly at first as the example sentnces will be simpler, and then gradually ramp it up as we get deeper into the guide.
