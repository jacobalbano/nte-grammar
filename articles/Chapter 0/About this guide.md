This guide won't teach you to speak Japanese. That's not something any guide is capable of doing.

The primary goal of this guide is to get you reading as quickly as possible while also considering the following: -

- You have a rough idea of how a Japanese sentence is formed and how each bit interacts with the rest.
- You can generally identify what is an actual word and what is just a grammar point.
- If you run into something you don't understand, you have an idea of where to start when thinking about how to unlock the meaning.
- If you really can't understand it yourself, you know what to look for online and you know how to formulate the questions you need to be asking.

(note: not sure if this fully covers user goals but thought it was a good set to start with - k)
