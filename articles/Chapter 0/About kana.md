The Japanese language has three fundamental scripts for writing the language: hiragana, katakana, and kanji.

This section of the guide covers the first two.  Kanji is discussed in the following section.

Japanese is fundamentally comprised of a set of sounds with each sound being made up of a vowel and potentially a consonant.  There are about 50 basic sounds in total.  Hiragana and katakana are used to write these fundamental sounds and each sound has a unique character.

This guide isn't designed to take you through and teach you all of the kana as there are already plenty of fantastic resources out there designed to do just that and a couple of them are listed below.

Tofugu's Guide:

This guide only takes you through hiragana but it does it in amazing detail with mnemonics (little stories/visual clues) for each one to help you remember.

Realkana:

Realkana lets you quiz yourself on kana you've already learned or if you prefer you can just learn them here through quizzing.  The contents of the quizzes are fully customisable so you can include or exclude whatever you want based on what you want to focus on.
