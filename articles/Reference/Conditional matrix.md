# AとB
when A happens, B will always happen
the cause and effect are directly linked and receive equal emphasis
> [!note] Example
> 目を閉じると　何も見えない
> if you close your eyes, you can't see

# AばB
if A happens, B will happen, with emphasis on the cause (A)
this emphasis makes ば conditionals especially suited to hypothetical situations
> [!note] Example
> 行けばよかった
> literally: if I go (hypothetical) that would be good
> more naturally: I should have gone; it would be good if I had gone

# AたらB
if A happens, B will happen, with emphasis on the effect (B)
this emphasis makes たら conditionals more suited to showing sequences of events where A must be completed before B can happen
> [!note] Example
> 仕事が終わったら帰る
> once work is over, I'll go home

# AならB
if A is true, then B is true also
there's no cause-effect relationship here at all
> [!note] Example
> 酒ならお付き合いしよう
> if you're drinking, I'll come with you
